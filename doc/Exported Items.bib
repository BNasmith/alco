	abstract = {In this book, Kevin McCrimmon describes the history of Jordan Algebras and he describes in full mathematical detail the recent structure theory for Jordan algebras of arbitrary dimension due to Efim Zel'manov. To keep the exposition elementary, the structure theory is developed for linear Jordan algebras, though the modern quadratic methods are used throughout. Both the quadratic methods and the Zelmanov results go beyond the previous textbooks on Jordan theory, written in the 1960's and 1980's before the theory reached its final form. This book is intended for graduate students and for individuals wishing to learn more about Jordan algebras. No previous knowledge is required beyond the standard first-year graduate algebra course. General students of algebra can profit from exposure to nonassociative algebras, and students or professional mathematicians working in areas such as Lie algebras, differential geometry, functional analysis, or exceptional groups and geometry can also profit from acquaintance with the material. Jordan algebras crop up in many surprising settings and can be applied to a variety of mathematical areas. Kevin McCrimmon introduced the concept of a quadratic Jordan algebra and developed a structure theory of Jordan algebras over an arbitrary ring of scalars. He is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia and the author of more than 100 research papers.},

Beginning with an elementary description of the Jordan algebra approach to the geometric and algebraic foundations of the theory, the book goes on to discuss harmonic analysis and special functions associated with symmetric cones, tying these results together with the study of holomorphic functions on bounded symmetric domains of tube type. Written by algebraic geometers, the book contains a detailed exposition of the spherical polynomials, multivariate hypergeometric functions, and invariant differential operators. The approach is based on Jordan algebras; all that is needed from the theory of these is developed in the first few chapters. The book will be read by students and theoreticians in pure mathematics, non-commutative harmonic analysis, Jordan algebras, and multivariate statistics.},

This handbook covers the constructions, properties, and applications of designs as well as existence results.Over 30\% longer than the first edition, the book builds upon the groundwork of its predecessor while retaining the original contributors' expertise. The first part contains a brief introduction and history of the subject. The following parts focus on four main classes of combinatorial designs: balanced incomplete block designs, orthogonal arrays and Latin squares, pairwise balanced designs, and Hadamard and orthogonal designs. Closely connected to the preceding sections, the next part surveys 65 additional classes of designs, such as balanced ternary, factorial, graphical, Howell, quasi-symmetric, and spherical. The final part presents mathematical and computational background related to design theory.New to the Second EditionAn introductory part that provides a general overview and a historical perspective of the areaNew chapters on the history of design theory, various codes, bent functions, and numerous types of designsFully updated tables, including BIBDs, MOLS, PBDs, and Hadamard matricesNearly 2,200 references in a single bibliographic sectionMeeting the need for up-to-date and accessible tabular and reference information, this handbook provides the tools to understand combinatorial design theory and applications that span the entire discipline.

Written by experts in the subject, each chapter unfolds from the basics to the more complex. The exposition is rapid-paced and efficient, without compromising proofs and examples that enable the reader to grasp the essentials. The most basic type of domain examined is the bounded symmetric domain, originally described and classified by Cartan and Harish- Chandra. Two of the five parts of the text deal with these domains: one introduces the subject through the theory of semisimple Lie algebras (Koranyi), and the other through Jordan algebras and triple systems (Roos). Larger classes of domains and spaces are furnished by the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric spaces and related R-spaces. These classes are covered via a study of their geometry and a presentation and classification of their Lie algebraic theory (Kaneyuki). In the fourth part of the book, the heat kernels of the symmetric spaces belonging to the classical Lie groups are determined (Lu). Explicit computations are made for each case, giving precise results and complementing the more abstract and general methods presented. Also explored are recent developments in the field, in particular, the study of complex semigroups which generalize complex tube domains and function spaces on them (Faraut). This volume will be useful as a graduate text for students of Lie group theory with connections to complex analysis, or as a self-study resource for newcomers to the field. Readers will reach the frontiers of the subject in a considerably shorter time than with existing texts.},

	url = {https://espace.rmc.ca/jspui/handle/11264/1423},
	abstract = {A t-design on a sphere or projective space is a finite subset such that the integral of any degree t polynomial over the sphere or projective space is equal to the average value of that polynomial evaluated at the points of the t-design. Tight t-designs are optimal in that they use the minimum possible 
number of points to achieve a particular value of t. Although t-designs are abundant, tight t-designs are rare structures in combinatorics that continue to resist a full classification. However, there are precisely four tight projective 5-designs: the vertices of a regular hexagon, the vertices of a regular icosahedron, the lines spanning the short vectors of the Leech lattice, and a set of points in the octonion projective plane forming a generalized hexagon finite geometry. This thesis explores the four tight projective 5-designs and their 
connections to various exceptional structures. The regular hexagon provides a starting point from which to recover Lie and Jordan theory. We explore an exceptional sequence of Lie algebras that terminates in the Lie algebra of the standard model of particle physics and provides a three generation representation of standard model fermions. The regular icosahedron is unique among tight t-designs, apart from most polygons on the unit circle, in that it has an irrational angle set. We provide proof of this fact by using Jordan algebras to generalize and correct certain previous attempts to prove that tight t-designs have rational angles. Finally, we explore the relationship between the two remaining tight 5-designs by examining octonion constructions of the Leech lattice and their octonion reflection symmetries. We introduce a common construction technique that yields the two remaining tight 5-designs and explore the role that  octonion integers and exceptional Jordan algebra integers can play in this common construction.},
