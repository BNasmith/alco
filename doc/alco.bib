	abstract = {The finite simple groups are the building blocks from which all the finite groups are made and as such they are objects of fundamental importance throughout mathematics. The classification of the finite simple groups was one of the great mathematical achievements of the twentieth century, yet these groups remain difficult to study which hinders applications of the classification. This textbook brings the finite simple groups to life by giving concrete constructions of most of them, sufficient to illuminate their structure and permit real calculations both in the groups themselves and in the underlying geometrical or algebraic structures. This is the first time that all the finite simple groups have been treated together in this way and the book points out their connections, for example between exceptional behaviour of generic groups and the existence of sporadic groups, and discusses a number of new approaches to some of the groups. Many exercises of varying difficulty are provided. The Finite Simple Groups is aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students in algebra as well as professional mathematicians and scientists who use groups and want to apply the knowledge which the classification has given us. The main prerequisite is an undergraduate course in group theory up to the level of Sylow’s theorems.},

	url = {https://espace.rmc.ca/jspui/handle/11264/1423},
	abstract = {A t-design on a sphere or projective space is a finite subset such that the integral of any degree t polynomial over the sphere or projective space is equal to the average value of that polynomial evaluated at the points of the t-design. Tight t-designs are optimal in that they use the minimum possible 
number of points to achieve a particular value of t. Although t-designs are abundant, tight t-designs are rare structures in combinatorics that continue to resist a full classification. However, there are precisely four tight projective 5-designs: the vertices of a regular hexagon, the vertices of a regular icosahedron, the lines spanning the short vectors of the Leech lattice, and a set of points in the octonion projective plane forming a generalized hexagon finite geometry. This thesis explores the four tight projective 5-designs and their 
connections to various exceptional structures. The regular hexagon provides a starting point from which to recover Lie and Jordan theory. We explore an exceptional sequence of Lie algebras that terminates in the Lie algebra of the standard model of particle physics and provides a three generation representation of standard model fermions. The regular icosahedron is unique among tight t-designs, apart from most polygons on the unit circle, in that it has an irrational angle set. We provide proof of this fact by using Jordan algebras to generalize and correct certain previous attempts to prove that tight t-designs have rational angles. Finally, we explore the relationship between the two remaining tight 5-designs by examining octonion constructions of the Leech lattice and their octonion reflection symmetries. We introduce a common construction technique that yields the two remaining tight 5-designs and explore the role that  octonion integers and exceptional Jordan algebra integers can play in this common construction.},
