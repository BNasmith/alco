  <Abstract>
    ALCO provides implementations in &GAP; of octonion algebras, Jordan algebras, and certain important integer subrings of those algebras. It also provides tools to compute the parameters of t-designs in spherical and projective spaces (modeled as manifolds of primitive idempotent elements in a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra). Finally, this package provides tools to explore octonion lattice constructions, including octonion Leech lattices.
